forEach(): loops over the stream elements, calling the supplied function on each element
map(): produces a new stream after applying a function to each element of the original stream. The new stream could be of different type => generates one output for each input element
collect(): gather the results of Stream to a Collection
filter(): produces a new stream that contains elements of the original stream that pass a given test (specified by a Predicate)
findFirst(): returns an Optional for the first entry in the stream
flatMap(): flatten the data structure to simplify further operations => used to map multiple-output for each input
sorted(): sort the elements in specified order
generate(): accepts a Supplier<T> for element generation
reduce(): combines all elements of Stream and produces single result
allMatch(): returns true when all the elements in the stream meet provided condition
nonMatch(): returns true when all the elements in the stream do not meet provided condition
